What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to prepare to commit only files that you wish to commite and not all files in a directory. The working houses all the files within the directory, the repository houses the files that you wish to commit, and the staging area is the space that allows you to commit those specific files you would like to commit rather than all the files in the working directory.
